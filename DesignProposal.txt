MedViz

Project Proposal

    The Medical Visualizer, or MedViz for short, is a data visualization application focused on empowering users to derive meaningful insights from 
medical data including but not limited to patient records, and administrative payroll information.


Systems Analysis

    MedViz extends the foundational, three-tiered data system by re-implementing it from the ground up with increased polish and refinement. The system will have a user
interface layer in which users interact with a simple to understand GUI to read data and visualize the results. Users will be able to create logins with special priviledges
for admin accounts with passwords being stored with proper password hashing and salting. Queries are processed and converted into accurate and
performant logic in the second client tier of the system. Additionally, The client tier is connected to a NoSQL database with a server front end that can handle multiple client 
requests and ultimatley serves results to clients using Restful APIs. The system will be concurrency safe to support multiple simultaneous client connections and
can even run certain query types in 
parallel to maximize server load efficiency. 


Data Sources

    Data is drawn from Synthea. A project released by best-in-class Not-for-profit MITRE containing synthetic patient and population health data from the state of
Massachusetts. Data will be loaded into and queried from a GCP Firestore NOSQL database hosted on a Firebase instance.
